# SpeedCrunch-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of the SpeedCrunch Calculator

Uses the portable release of SpeedCrunch and turns it into an AppImage: https://bitbucket.org/heldercorreia/speedcrunch/downloads/

You can also run the `speedcrunch-appimage.sh` script in your machine to make the AppImage.

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend this alternative instead: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without `fuse2` as it can use `fuse3` instead.
