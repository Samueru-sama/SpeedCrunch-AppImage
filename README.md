# SpeedCrunch-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of the SpeedCrunch Calculator, uses the [portable release](https://bitbucket.org/heldercorreia/speedcrunch/downloads/) of SpeedCrunch and turns it into an AppImage.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**

You can also run the `speedcrunch-appimage.sh` script in your machine to make the AppImage.

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend this alternative instead: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without `fuse2` as it can use `fuse3` instead.
